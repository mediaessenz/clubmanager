Location
========

Location data records are always linked to a member data record
and can only be created and edited via the associated member record.
Basically, :guilabel:`Main location` and :guilabel:`Other locations`
have the same data structure. While there can be only one main site, there are
many :guilabel:`Other locations` possible.
With the `:ext:clubmanager` there is the possibility to output a list of all locations of
members as well as to offer a categorization of member locations by
the city. See :ref:`plugins <plugins>` for more information.

.. only:: html

   .. contents::
      :local:
      :depth: 1

.. important::

    The locations are used to provide a register of the members in the frontend
    to make the locations accessible and searchable for visitors.
    Additional search and sort functions are available with the add-ons
    :ref:`ext:clubmanager_zip_search <clubmanagerZipSearch>` and
    :ref:`ext:clubmanager_faceted_search <clubmanagerFacetedSearch>`.

===================
Location data records are always linked to a member data record

.. note::

    A TYPO3 module with extensive search function, improved view and
    extended options, is available with the :ref:`ext:clubmanager_pro
    <clubmanagerPro>`!
