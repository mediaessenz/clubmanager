         .. container:: card-body

            Location records are always directly linked to a member record.
            Members can have one main location and several secondary locations.
            Location records can be displayed by the plugin and are sortable
            out-of-the-box by city.

         .. container:: card-body

            E-Mail Tasks are automatically generated by the plugin to send
            different emails to members and to be able to track the sending of
            the emails.
